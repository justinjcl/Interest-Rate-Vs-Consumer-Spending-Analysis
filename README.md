# Interest-Rate-Vs-Consumer-Spending-Analysis

This repo contains my project exploring the relationship between Interest Rates set by the Federal Bank Reserve and consumer behavior as well as business investments. 

# Main Objective

In this project, I want to explore the replationship between interest rates and consumer spending patterns. By analyzing historical interest rate data alongside consumer expenditure trends, my goal is to understand better how changes in monetary policy
influence consumer behavior. The project utilizes R and applies regression analysis to identify correlations, examine potential lag effects, and discover broader economic implications of rising or falling interest rates on household spending decisions.
